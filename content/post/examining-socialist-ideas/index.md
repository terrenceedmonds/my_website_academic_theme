I've been wanting to examine the idea of Universal Basic Income (UBI) for a while now. And with Andrew Yang having run for president recently with this idea as his base, along with coronavirus shutting the countries economy down and forcing new discussions about some limited income for all Americans, at least as a temporary measure, this seems like a great time to start investigating this idea. As with any complex topic, there are many avenues of thought, and I won't dare try to represent them all. I primarily want to look at this question: is UBI possible?

From the news and less liberal minded people, the answer I hear is most often, "of course not. How are you going to pay for it?" And this seems like a fair point. Let's take an estimate monthly pay of 2000 USD (24000 USD yearly) for every adult in the United States. With a population of ~330 Million people, this comes out too  $660 trillion a month. Compare this to US GDP in 2017 of 19.39 trillion USD and a clear problem seems to arise. 

Before I go further in this analysis, I want to make it explicitly clear that I am and have been trained as a physicist, not an economist. I want to explore what GDP is later, but taking at face that it is a value that represents all the spending in the US, there is a clear discrepancy between the yearly spending in the US, and what the government would spend alone on UBI.

With this problem highlighted, let's now explore a thought experiment. Imagine we live in a world where all work can be done entirely by robots/machines. From production, to running businesses, to solving novel problems in science that lead to further advancements for people. Furthermore, these aren't sentient robots, so there is no need to consider their feelings, or look out for them past the point of maintenance, which other robots can do. The question I ask now is, can we meet every persons needs in this world? 

Looking at one source, https://medium.com/@jeremyerdman/we-produce-enough-food-to-feed-10-billion-people-so-why-does-hunger-still-exist-8086d2657539, it seems that enough food is produced to feed everyone in the world. I would also put forward that the primary reason for homelessness is that those people cannot afford to live somewhere. With these two conditions met, it seems that every persons basic needs would be met. So if these two needs can be met in this world, why can we not afford UBI?

Before begining the dive into what I will probably refer to as the wealth paradox, or some other nice sounding name, I should address the first counter argument that I can think of: your thought experiment world is too unrealistic and isn't even worth considering. 

As the creator of this thought experiment (though I'm certain I'm not the first person to imagine this kind of world) I obviously think it has merit, but let me justify it. I think we're already fairly close to this kind of world, and we would be much closer to it if it weren't for this need for jobs for people in the first place. Capitalism is arguably slowing down progress in this area. Checkout lines in Walmarts have mostly replaced people with self checkouts, and McDonalds have kiosks where you can place your order without ever interacting with a person.

With autonomous vehicles already here, and less prone to accidents than people already, it makes sense that they replace truck drivers and taxis. Machines, even if they never completely take over all of the jobs that I mentioned, can take over huge portions of the economy, which will leave countless people without a job in that sector, and they then have to move to another job. Machines are cheaper to maintain than a person, and are generally more efficient. So while the world I described may not be 100% accurate, I think it is certainly close enough that it is at least worth examining, and trying to gain insight about how we could at least improve our current system, if not overhaul it entirely.

The first answer that seems obvious in bridging this paradox is inflation. Things in the world we currently live in cost more than they should for most people. I think this is most obvious when people look at health care and housing. Hospitals charge far too much for treating patients, medicines cost too much buy, and apartments in California are just the tiniest bit expensive. 

A second factor might be scarcity. The reason housing costs so much in large cities is because many people want to live there, and with limited space, the cost goes up.
