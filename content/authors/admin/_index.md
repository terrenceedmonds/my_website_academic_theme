Hi, I'm Terrence and welcome to my website. I'm a recent physics graduate from Purdue University. I plan to use this site as a place to host or put up various projects of mine that I find interesting. This site is new, so it is in fact a new and ongoing project, and I haven't yet fixed all of the sections yet.

During my time as a graduate student, I worked as an experimental physicist in a High Energy Nuclear Physics (HENP) group studying the dynamics of a state of matter called Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). For most of my time in that group, I investigated a resonance called f0(980), which is interesting because it is a possible four quark candidate. Most matter that you are familiar with has three quarks, and no particles or resonances have been discovered to have any number of quarks other than two or three.
